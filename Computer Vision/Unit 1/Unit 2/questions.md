3. Computer :
- Computer: This is the central processing unit, which can range from a personal computer to a supercomputer, that executes the image processing algorithms.

4. Image Processing Software: This is the core of the system, comprising algorithms and modules for image manipulation.
- Specialized Modules: These perform specific tasks, such as:
    - Image Enhancement: Algorithms for adjusting brightness, contrast, and sharpness.
    - Image Restoration: Techniques to remove noise, blur, and other degradations.
    - Image Segmentation: Algorithms that partition an image into meaningful regions or objects.
    - Image Compression: Methods for reducing file size for efficient storage and transmission (e.g., JPEG).

- Libraries and Frameworks: Popular software libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch provide a wide range of pre-built functions and tools for developing image processing applications.

5. Mass Storage: Image data is typically large, so storage is a critical component.
- Short-term storage: Used during processing, often in the form of computer memory or specialized frame buffers.
- On-line storage: For fast recall, such as magnetic or optical disks.
- Archival storage: For massive storage needs with infrequent access, like magnetic tapes or "jukeboxes."

6. Hardcopy Devices: These are used to create physical copies of the images.
- Examples include laser printers, inkjet printers, and film cameras , external ROM or pendrives

7. Image Displays: These devices are used to visualize the images.
- The most common are high-resolution color monitors, which are driven by graphics cards.
- Advanced systems may include stereo displays or specialized monitors for medical imaging.



# Major Classifications of Image Sensors
1. Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) Sensor
- Captures light and converts it to electrical charge.
- Transfers the charge across the chip to a readout amplifier.
- Known for high image quality and low noise.

2. Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Sensor
- Each pixel has its own amplifier.
- Converts light directly into voltage.
- Offers faster readout, lower power consumption, and integration with circuits.

## Working of Image Sensors
- Light to charge Conversion 
- Charge Accumulation
- Transfer 
- Chrage to voltage conversion
- Amplification
