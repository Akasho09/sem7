## 4️⃣ What is FP-Growth Algorithm?
- A faster algorithm than Apriori.
- It does not generate candidates.
- Instead, it builds an FP-tree and mines frequent patterns from it.

## 5️⃣ What are Closed and Max Itemsets?
- Closed itemset:
No superset has the same support.
- Max itemset:
No superset is frequent.
(Max is a subset of closed.)
