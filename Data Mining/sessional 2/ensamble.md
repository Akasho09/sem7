## Bootstrapping 
is a sampling technique used to create multiple datasets from the original data by random sampling with replacement.


## Bagging 
is an ensemble method that builds multiple models (usually the same type, like Decision Trees) on different bootstrap samples, then aggregates (averages or votes) their predictions.


## Boosting 
is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each new model focusing on the errors (residuals) made by the previous ones.
