## What do you understand by central tendency of data? How is it measured?
- Central tendency refers to a statistical concept that identifies the central value or typical value around which the entire dataset tends to cluster.
    - It gives a single representative value that summarizes the whole dataset.
    - Measures of Central Tendency
### Central tendency is mainly measured using:
1. Mean (Arithmetic Average)
- Calculated by dividing the sum of all observations by the number of observations.

2. Median
- The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
    - If 𝑛 is odd → middle value.
    - If 𝑛 is even → average of the two middle values.

3. Mode
- The value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.
- Useful for categorical data.

- These measures help in understanding the overall distribution and provide a basis for comparison between different datasets.

## ii) Give a brief explanation for data reduction strategies.
- Data reduction refers to the process of minimizing the volume of data while preserving its meaningful information and integrity.
- It improves storage efficiency, reduces computation time, and enhances data processing performance.
- Its a Preprocess Techinique 

- Major Data Reduction Strategies
1. Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduces the number of attributes or features.
- Techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), feature selection, attribute subset selection.

2. Numerosity Reduction
- Reduces the data volume by replacing the data with smaller forms that still retain essential information.
- Methods include:
    - Data aggregation (averages, sums)
    - Sampling
    - Histograms
    - Clustering
    - Regression models

3. Data Compression
- Encodes data in a more compact form.
- Can be lossless (no information lost) or lossy (some information lost but acceptable for analysis).

- These strategies help make data analysis faster, more efficient, and more scalable.
