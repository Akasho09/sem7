## ✅ Architecture of Mobile Computing
The architecture is typically structured into three main components:

1. 1️⃣ Mobile Device or Mobile Terminal
- Portable device with computing and communication capabilities
- Examples: Smartphones, tablets, laptops
- Functions: Data input, processing, wireless communication, display

2. 2️⃣ Base Station Subsystem (Network Infrastructure)
- Provides wireless communication between mobile devices and core network
- Consists of:
- Base Stations (BTS): Handles radio communication with devices
- Base Station Controller (BSC): Manages multiple BTS units
- Mobile Switching Center (MSC): Handles call routing, mobility management, etc.

3. 3️⃣ Mobile Network or Core Network
- Manages authentication, roaming, billing, and data services
- Connects mobile users to external networks like the internet and PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).


## ✅ Generation of Mobile Services

1. 📶 1G – First Generation (Analog Cellular Network)
