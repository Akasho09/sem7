- trianlgle = 17% circle area
- square = 63
- hexagon = 83

## Trunking 
is a method of efficiently sharing a limited number of communication channels among a larger number of users. Instead of allocating a dedicated channel to each user, multiple users share the available channels, and a channel is assigned to a user only when needed.
