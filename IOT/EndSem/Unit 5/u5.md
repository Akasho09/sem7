## Sensors and Actuators in IoT
1. Sensors
- What they do: Convert a physical quantity into an electrical signal.
- Temperature sensor → voltage changes with temperature
- LDR (light sensor) → resistance changes with light
- Ultrasonic sensor → time of echo gives distance
- In IoT: Sensors collect data from the environment and send it to a microcontroller (Arduino, ESP8266, etc.) which then sends it to the cloud or performs local decisions.

2. Actuators
- What they do: Convert electrical signals into physical action.
- Examples:
- Motors → rotation / motion
- Relay → turns AC devices ON/OFF
- Buzzer → sound
- Servo / stepper → precise movement
- In IoT: Actuators perform actions based on commands from software (e.g., turn ON fan when temperature > 30°C).

## Controlling Hardware
- “Controlling hardware” means using a microcontroller’s pins (digital/analog) to read sensors and drive actuators.
- Input side:
    - digitalRead() or analogRead() to sense buttons, LDR, temperature, motion, etc.
- Output side:
    - digitalWrite() to turn things ON/OFF (LED, relay, buzzer).
    - analogWrite() (PWM) to control speed/brightness/position.
- Because microcontroller pins can only give small current (~20–40 mA), we often need:
- Transistors / MOSFETs / Drivers to control motors, relays, etc.
- External power supply for high-power loads.

## 3. Connecting LED
- LED (Light Emitting Diode) glows when current flows in forward direction.
- Always use a current-limiting resistor (e.g., 220–1kΩ) in series.
- Connection:
- Anode (+ longer leg) → resistor → microcontroller pin
- Cathode (– shorter leg, flat side) → GND
- Code: set that pin as OUTPUT and use digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW).

## 4. Buzzer
- Two types:
    - Active buzzer: Just give 5V or a digital HIGH → it produces a fixed tone.
    - Passive buzzer: Needs a square wave (PWM) at certain frequency to create sound.
- Connection similar to LED, often with a small transistor if current is higher.
- Can be used for alarms, beeps in intruder alert, etc.

## 5. Controlling AC Power Devices with Relays
- Relay: An electrically controlled switch that can turn high-voltage AC (fan, bulb, pump) ON or OFF using low-voltage 5V signal from microcontroller.
- Inside a relay:
- Coil: creates magnetic field when energized.
- Contacts: move to connect/disconnect AC circuit (NO/NC terminals).
- We never connect AC directly to microcontroller. Instead:
- Microcontroller pin → transistor/optocoupler → relay coil
- AC live wire → relay common & NO (or NC) → load (bulb/fan).
- In IoT, relays are used in smart home: remote control of lights, appliances via Wi-Fi.
- Safety note: AC wiring must be done carefully, usually with pre-built relay modules.
