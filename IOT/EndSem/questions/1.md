| Feature              | Raspberry Pi                                                   | Arduino                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**             | Single-board computer                                          | Microcontroller board                                |
| **Operating System** | Runs full OS (e.g., Linux)                                     | No OS, runs single program                           |
| **Processing Power** | High (1.2 GHz+ CPU, multitasking)                              | Low (16–100 MHz, single task)                        |
| **Memory**           | Large RAM (512 MB–8 GB)                                        | Very small RAM (2 KB–8 KB)                           |
| **Applications**     | Complex tasks: IoT servers, ML, robotics with camera, web apps | Real-time control: sensors, motors, embedded systems |
| **Boot Time**        | Slow (10–30 sec)                                               | Instant (<1 sec)                                     |
| **I/O**              | Limited real-time performance                                  | Excellent real-time performance                      |
| **Programming**      | Python, C++, Java, OS-level apps                               | C/C++ (Arduino IDE), bare-metal control              |

- Use Raspberry Pi when you need multitasking, networking, camera, or high processing.
- Use Arduino when you need real-time control, simple sensor/motor handling, and reliability.
