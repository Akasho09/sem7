### importance
- Apples are a great global importance 
    ‚Ä¢ Among the top four most cultivated fruits worldwide (>80M tons annually).

- and in India 
    ‚Ä¢ Though only Himachal Pradesh & Jammu & Kashmir are major producers.
    ‚Ä¢ Still it Contributes substantially to horticulture sector and in turn horticulture contributes ‚âà30% to Indian agriculture GDP . 
    However, despite a 20% increase in the area of apple cultivation, production has risen by only 1‚Äì2%. The main reason is frequent disease outbreaks.

### Apple Scab: A Major Threat
    Among these diseases, the most destructive is Apple Scab, caused by the Venturia inaequalis fungus. 
    It appears as olive-green to dark lesions on leaves and fruits, leading to defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, degraded fruit quality, and yield losses.

### Here is the Problem statement
    Apple Scab is global problem , caused by Venturia inaequalis, is a serious threat to apple production. It reduces photosynthesis, lowers fruit quality, and ultimately causes large economic losses worldwide, including in India.

#### Traditional methods to detect severity have limitations:

    - Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and labor-intensive.
    - Laboratory methods like PCR or serological tests are accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and not feasible for large-scale farm use.

#### With the progress of deep learning, CNNs 
    - can now classify apple leaves with over 95% accuracy ‚Äì but these models mostly tell whether a leaf is healthy or diseased, not how severe the infection is.

- The challenge/Research gap is that most severity estimation methods require pixel-level lesion masks, which need expert annotation, are costly, and don‚Äôt scale well for large datasets.

- So, there is a critical need for a method that is:
    - Weakly supervised (works with only image-level labels),
    - Scalable and cost-effective,
    - And provides fast severity estimation to support better crop management.

## From ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow Much‚Äù

### What We Know
   - Currently, CNNs are extremely powerful in classifying plant diseases. In fact, they achieve more than 98% accuracy. This means we can confidently answer the question: ‚ÄòWhat disease is present?‚Äô
    - But in real-world crop management, knowing what disease is present is not enough. Farmers and agronomists need to know ‚ÄòHow much‚Äô of the plant is affected ‚Äì in other words, the severity percentage of the infection.‚Äù

### The Problem
- To estimate severity, the traditional approach has been fully supervised segmentation.
    That means creating pixel-level masks of lesions for every training image.
- But this process is very expensive, time-consuming, and requires domain experts.
So, it is not practical for building large-scale severity estimation systems.


### So whats The Opportunity
- With weakly supervised methods like Grad-CAM, we can localize diseased regions using only image-level labels ‚Äì no need for detailed pixel annotations.
- In fact, prior research ‚Äì like Shukla et al., 2020 ‚Äì has already shown that this approach is feasible.
But their work stopped at visual localization. In other words, they generated heatmaps, but did not convert them into severity estimates.

### The Gap & Our Contribution

Currently, there is no validated method to convert Grad-CAM heatmaps into quantitative severity scores.

- And this is where our contribution comes in.
    - We propose a method to transform Grad-CAM heatmaps into pseudo-masks.
    - From these masks, we derive severity scores that represent the percentage of area infected.
    - This gives us actionable insights for farmers and crop managers.
    - Most importantly, our framework is low-cost, scalable, and deployable ‚Äì making severity estimation feasible at field scale.


## Data Sets :
- For this study, we used data from the PlantVillage dataset, specifically focusing on the Apple category.

- We created two versions of the dataset:
    - Dataset 1 ‚Äì Original: Raw leaf images with natural backgrounds.
    - Dataset 2 ‚Äì Background Removed: Pre-processed images where the leaf was segmented, removing background noise for cleaner feature extraction.‚Äù
